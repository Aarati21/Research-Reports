[Advanced decision making by combining Hamilton Jacobi reachability and path planning for cyclist vehicle navigation](https://github.com/Aarati21/Research-Reports/blob/master/Thesis%20draft.pdf)

Navigating a virtual agent at traffic intersections (roundabouts) - SafeAILabReport
Trained a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to navigate a virtual agent by using the Stanford drone dataset as ground truth
Demonstrated superiority of the latter over a Q network at collision avoidance and navigation
